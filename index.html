        <p class="paragraph"><b> E-Commerce Multi-vendor Project using Spring Boot & React Js </b> ensures a seamless
            experience for all involved. As an administrator, you can easily add product categories to the system. The
            seller can register himself in the system and after login, he can add multiple delivery persons for him, he
            can add his products to the system by selecting the product category to which the admin was added.
            Basically, Multiple Sellers can add their multiple products to the system. Once the Seller adds the product,
            all the customers who will visit the website will be able to see the products along with the seller's
            details. And they will be able to search the products by selecting the category and also they can view
            products based on the seller.
            Customers can add the products to the cart and order the products from the cart. After the Orders, Sellers
            will be able to view their Orders and now they can assign their delivery person for the order deliveries.
            Once the delivery person is assigned to the order, the delivery person can log into the system and update
            the order delivery status at any time. In the end, the Customer will be able to see the updated status of
            his orders and Admin will be able to see the complete order details of all the customers from all sellers.

            admin can log in to the system. By using the below form, All users (Admin, Seller, Delivery & Customer) can
            log into the system by selecting the user role.</p>
